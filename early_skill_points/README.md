# Early Skill Points
This mod allows you to lower the minimum level at which you start gaining skill points. 
- Setting it to one give you a skill point at level 1 to use on your action skill.
- There is also an option to choose when to stop gaining skill points, if you want to offset the early skill points gained.
- Skill points are generated when your character is created, there is no risk of permanently losing them.

Credit and thanks to **ZetaDaemon** for creating the original code and allowing me to port it into a full SDK mod.
